# finalProjectBrief

Technical:
- For my project, I am going to be using a credit card swiper (http://www.amazon.com/MagTek-21040145-SureSwipe-Magnetic-Interface/dp/B00EUMXPC4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431892344&sr=8-1&keywords=MagTek+21040145+SureSwipe+Card+Reader) as my alternative interface. When the interactant swipes their personal credit card, the openFrameworks application reads their important card information such as account number, service code and expiration date, then creates a generative art image. The image will be saved as a pdf file, or, if possible, sent directly to a printer and printed out. 
- The connection between the card data and the output image is that the data is used as parameters that are passed into different particle classes. Each image will be unique in details but the fundamental structures are the same. 
- The addon I am going to use is https://github.com/fakelove/ofxCreditCardSwiper.

Conceptual:
- Credit cards are generally considered a symbol of wealth and power. Sometimes, the society tends to define who we are by how much spending ability we have. The empowerment in my project happens when the functionality of a credit card - purchasing mechandise, is obscured. The numbers on our cards are no longer simply security information that enables us to spend money. They can also be plugged into a pre-written generative art algorithm that produces beautiful images. This project shows that a credit card swiper does not have to always verify the remaining balance of the card and determine how much money you can spend on a piece of mechandise. Without any judgement on how wealthy you are, you can still receive a piece of art that is uniquely beautiful. 
- Some inspiration on generative art from the Internet:
